# Pandemic Legacy Season 2 Prologue

## Project Background
This project is a web application that recreates the prologue of "Pandemic Legacy Season 2." Developed with Svelte and TypeScript, it represents my first foray into TypeScript. Inspired by my passion for cooperative board games and the challenge of maintaining the game experience for my friends and me between our infrequent meetups, this app aims to make the prologue of the game, which becomes inaccessible after the game starts, digitally available.

The "Pandemic" board game is a cooperative game where players work together as members of a disease control team to manage outbreaks and save the world from four deadly diseases. "Pandemic Legacy: Season 2" is a sequel and standalone game set in the same universe, featuring an evolving narrative and gameplay that changes over time, set in a post-apocalyptic world where players face new challenges and a unique storyline that unfolds over a year of gameplay.

## Project Structure

### Game Board Visualization and Interaction
 
**Board Components (`Board.svelte`, `BoardLayout.svelte`):** These form the heart of the game's visual interface. `Board.svelte` dynamically overlays game states onto the board, while `BoardLayout.svelte`  is responsible for the static aspects of the game board.

**Field Components (`Field.svelte`, `Location.svelte`, etc.):**
They represent individual locations on the board, handling both the display (labels, supply areas) and player interactions (like moving and action execution).

### Player Interaction and Management
**Player Dashboard (`PlayerDashboard.svelte`):** This is a central hub for player interactions, bifurcating into areas like PlayerSupplyArea for managing player supplies and CardManagementArea for handling player cards.

**City Cards and Build Area:** These components manage specific player actions like building supply centers, showcasing some creative approach to UI design with features like sliders for confirming construction actions.

### Game Logic and Mechanics
**Action Handlers (`actionUtils.ts`, `playerMovements.ts`, etc.):** These scripts define the logic for each player action, crucial for the game mechanics.

**Deck Management (`deckInitialization.ts`, `playerDeck.ts`, etc.):** They handle the initialization and dynamics of the game decks, a core part of Pandemic's gameplay.

### Advanced State Management
**GameState Store:** It serves as a 'single source of truth', tracking all the dynamic elements of a game session for robust state management.

**TurnState Store:** This store captures the sequence of actions in a turn, allowing for features like undoing actions. It employs a player-agnostic approach and an efficient data structure.

## Current Development

ðŸ“Œ  **Integration of TailwindCSS**: To replace the provisional inline styling.

ðŸ“Œ **Disease and Epidemic Mechanics**: A key game component yet to be realized.

ðŸ“Œ  **Implementation of Victory/Loss Conditions**: Adding these elements will complete the game loop, bringing it closer to the original board game experience.

ðŸ“Œ  **Event Cards and Character Abilities**: Game elements still to be implemented, will introduce more depth and variety to the gameplay.

ðŸ“Œ **GameHistory Store:** For a complete tracking of the game progression.
